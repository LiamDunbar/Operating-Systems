1 - Managing the computer's resources. This includes the CPU, volatile and nonvolatile memory (HDD/SDD/GPU). It controls the prioritization of memory, or where the memory should be allocated to. In order to allocate memory efficiently it also has to keep the data organized.
2-  It also provides communication between the hardware and software parts of a computer. It determines how the user interfaces with the system to open applications, and how certain applications should be displayed to the user. It also sometimes let's the user put input into the system and then recieve feedback based on the input.
3 - Another OS function would be managing how software applications are executed. This ties into how much memory is allocated to these processes which determines how these proccesses perform, but it also determines if there are any security issues/risks with said processes. It can also detect errors with the program and output what the computer determines to be the origin of said error.
